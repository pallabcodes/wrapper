# Customization Guide

This guide explains safe customization points that preserve non breaking guarantees.

## Configuration
1. Use forRoot and forFeature to inject options.
2. Prefer environment variables for sensitive values.
3. Keep defaults secure and production ready.

## Auth and RBAC
1. Strategies can be replaced via standard Nest module providers.
2. RBAC policies are composed through decorators that merge.
3. No library code may assume specific role names.

## Internal module DX
1. Provide typed decorators, guards, and helpers to reduce wiring verbosity.
2. Add optional behaviors behind configuration flags with safe defaults.
3. Keep public APIs stable; extend via additive options and providers.

## Extensibility
1. Use well named interfaces for user and context types.
2. Provide adapters and inject abstractions where needed.
3. Keep example code concise and typed.
