# Documentation Standards

## Required sections per package
1. Overview and goals
2. Public API with types
3. Quick start and examples
4. Configuration and defaults
5. Limits and caveats and security notes
6. Changelog and migration notes when relevant

## Quality
1. Examples compile and reflect real usage
2. Code samples follow project style and language rules
3. Docs are concise and actionable

## Parity
1. Examples should be covered by smoke tests where possible
2. Keep docs updated with changes in the same pull request
3. Use review checklist to verify docs completeness
