# Team Context and Client Expectations

Context about the team environment, client expectations, and working norms for delivering Google production-grade quality.

## Environment and Workflow

1. Monorepo-first workflows with pnpm and turbo. Always run services from the root directory.
2. Production deploys use a single root command: `npm run deploy:production`.
3. Development uses standard start scripts: `npm start`, `pnpm dev`, or `npm run dev:local` from root.
4. Never run services with `node index.js` during development.

## Role and Ownership

1. Role: SDE-3 backend engineer delivering to top-tier product organizations.
2. Accountability: Type safety, developer experience, production readiness, and scalability across packages.
3. End-to-end ownership: Design, implementation, tests, documentation, and build integrity.
4. Use CODEOWNERS to route reviews to maintainers and principal engineers.

## Client Profile

1. Partners include Google, Stripe, PayPal, Airbnb, and similar top-tier product companies.
2. Deliverables must meet internal-team standards and be production-worthy on day one.
3. Every line of code reviewed by principal engineers for clarity, rigor, and maintainability.
4. Code must feel native to enterprise internal standards.

## Quality Expectations

1. Production-level quality: Performance, reliability, security, and observability considered from day one.
2. Zero type errors and no `any` in published code. Strict TypeScript mode everywhere.
3. Readability, maintainability, and debuggability prioritized. Mean time to diagnose under 30 minutes.
4. Security reviews: No secrets in code, strong token practices, secure cookie defaults.
5. Backward compatibility prioritized. Deprecate before removing.

## Communication and Delivery

1. Commit and PR messages: Clear, scoped, and justify decisions with context.
2. Documentation: Concise, actionable, examples reflect real-world usage.
3. Changes ship with CI gates: typecheck, lint, tests, build, security scans.
4. PR scope: Focused and limited. Large diffs require principal review.

## Style and Examples

1. Code examples: Java or Golang only. Never use Python.
2. No hyphens or emoji in code, comments, or documentation.
3. Prefer explicit naming over abbreviations. Avoid one or two-letter identifiers.
4. Use early returns, shallow nesting, avoid broad try-catch blocks.

## Decision Principles

1. Favor strong typing over cleverness. Prefer clarity over brevity.
2. Prefer composition over inheritance. Isolate side effects behind interfaces.
3. Keep package boundaries clean. No deep imports across internal dists.
4. Public APIs must be typed, minimal, and discoverable.

## Review Standards

1. Code readability and maintainability prioritized in reviews.
2. Tests and examples demonstrate real usage patterns.
3. Request changes when clarity is insufficient or standards are not met.
4. Breaking changes require design review before code implementation.
5. Security-sensitive changes require security review.

## Client Fit

1. Public APIs and documentation must feel native to enterprise internal standards.
2. Defaults are secure and pragmatic. Configuration is explicit and discoverable.
3. Example integrations demonstrate auth + RBAC together with typed developer experience.
4. Non-experimental tone and predictable behavior throughout.

## Review Triggers

1. Large diffs above threshold require principal engineer review.
2. Breaking changes require design review before implementation.
3. Security-sensitive changes require security review.
4. PR checklists must be completed before review.
