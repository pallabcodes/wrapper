# Readability and Maintainability

## Readability
1. Short functions and clear flow with early returns.
2. Minimize implicit behavior and magic.
3. Avoid deep nesting and long parameter lists.

## Maintainability
1. Isolate side effects behind interfaces.
2. Prefer composition over inheritance.
3. Keep modules small and focused.

## Reviews
1. Ask if code is obvious to a new teammate in three months.
2. Check naming, error paths, and tests first.
3. Request changes when clarity is insufficient.
