# Ownership and Review Process

Standards for code ownership, review routing, and pull request expectations.

## Code Ownership

1. Use CODEOWNERS file to route reviews to maintainers and principal engineers.
2. Each package must list owners in CODEOWNERS file.
3. Ownership implies accountability for quality, releases, and maintenance.
4. Owners are responsible for reviewing changes and maintaining package health.

## Review Triggers

1. Large diffs above threshold (e.g., 500+ lines) require principal engineer review.
2. Breaking changes require design review before code implementation.
3. Security-sensitive changes require security review from security team.
4. Architectural changes require architecture review and ADR updates.

## Pull Request Expectations

1. **Scope**: PRs are focused and limited to a single feature or fix.
2. **Commits**: Commits are descriptive with clear messages explaining what and why.
3. **Checklists**: PR template checklists must be completed before review.
4. **Linked Issues**: Link related issues and ADRs where applicable.
5. **Description**: PR description explains context, approach, and testing.

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one approval from code owner.
2. Principal engineer approval required for breaking changes and large diffs.
3. Security review required for authentication, authorization, and data handling changes.
4. CI checks must pass before approval and merge.

## Ownership Responsibilities

1. Maintain code quality and test coverage.
2. Review and approve changes to owned packages.
3. Respond to issues and support requests.
4. Plan and execute releases for owned packages.
5. Update documentation and examples.

## Review Best Practices

1. Review for correctness, clarity, and adherence to standards.
2. Request changes when standards are not met or clarity is insufficient.
3. Approve when code meets quality standards and is ready for production.
4. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
