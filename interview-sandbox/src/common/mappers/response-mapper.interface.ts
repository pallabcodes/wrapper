/**
 * ResponseMapper Interface
 * 
 * Each controller should have its own ResponseMapper implementation
 * to transform domain entities/DTOs into standardized API responses.
 * 
 * This ensures:
 * - Consistent response formats across endpoints
 * - Easy to match expected response formats (assignments, API contracts)
 * - Separation of concerns (controllers don't format responses)
 * - Easy to change response format without touching business logic
