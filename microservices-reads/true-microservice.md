Do not write any code but first let us brrainstorm and pick the best tech-stack for this project out of carefully selected 10 projects.

One of most importnat aspect of this project is that it should be `Google Scale` as well if hypothetically Google closes down or shringkin their team, this project should allow me to stay there because my skillset and expertise because even among 1000+ of SDEs in all of Google, I am one of the best and handpicked skill-wise.

I am a SDE-3 backend enginner at Google but I also support as Infra engineer as well as Low level system engineer. Now one of my principle engineers has asked me to build a truly `Google-Scale` microservice project based on tech-stack 

I know : Java, Golang, Python, Node.js, Rust, C/C++

# The purpose behind this project is that other team can look at this like a standard from architechture, folder strucutre, code READABILTIY, MAINTAIBLTIY, DEBUABILTY, SCALABILITY, and DEPLOYMENT

- It should off course the most obvious ones when comes to microservices e.g. API Gateway, NGIX, ECS/EKS, ALB, SQS, SNS, SES, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, AuroraDB, Kinesis, EventBridge, and other most obvious AWS services including AI services basically anythign and everything that comes under AWS free tiers.

- Now, off course this project should event-driven aspects with KAFKA/Kinesis, EventBridge and off course AI and as well as Image/video processing and security, cryptography, and other most obvious security measures.

N.B: I hope that you get what I mean
