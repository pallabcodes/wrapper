# Architecture Rules

## Boundaries
1. No cycles in dependency graph across packages
2. Import only from public index of other packages
3. Keep module surfaces small and stable

## Layers
1. Separate domain and application and infrastructure concerns
2. Keep side effects behind interfaces
3. Prefer composition over inheritance

## ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

1. Capture significant architectural decisions in short ADRs.
2. Record context, decision rationale, and consequences.
3. Link ADRs from relevant code and documentation.
4. Review ADRs during code reviews when architectural changes are made.
